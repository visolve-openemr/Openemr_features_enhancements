# OpenEMR Manual Test Suite

### Objective
High-quality manual test cases need to be built up and maintained moving forward. A group of testers can run through them before releases are shipped and developers can also use them as a point of reference/sanity check when doing the big codebase refactor project.

### Contribute
The tests are checked into this area and are written in markdown format. It turns out that [bulleted lists in markdown tables are not supported](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19950648/how-to-write-lists-inside-a-markdown-table), so plain old HTML tables are leveraged instead (markdown can handle basic HTML).

Use the following [WYSIWYG HTML editor](http://bestonlinehtmleditor.com/) and [Markdown check](https://stackedit.io/editor) tools like so:
